**Modlee Exercise**
===================

In this exercise, we will be assesing your ability to define a custom
neural network for optimizing performance on a dataset.

You will use the ``modlee`` package to: - Obtain your interview dataset
and solution requirements - Define custom neural networks (~10) - Use
Modlee to train neural networks and preserve your experimentation -
Submit trained neural networks for evaluation

Expectations
------------

-  Candidates typically experiment with at least **10** different model
   architectures during this exercise: defining the model, training, and
   submitting for evaluation

Tips
----

For best performance, ensure that the runtime is set to use a GPU
(``Runtime > Change runtime type > T4 GPU``).

Help & Questions
----------------

If you have any questions about the interview, please reachout on our
`Discord <https://discord.gg/dncQwFdN9m>`__ #help-exercise channel.

You can also use our
`documenation <https://docs.modlee.ai/README.html>`__ as a reference for
using our package.

.. code:: ipython3

    %%capture
    !pip install modlee torch torchvision pytorch-lightning

**Environment setup**
=====================

Step 1
------

We need to install ``modlee`` and its related packages. Make sure that
you have a Modlee account and API key `from the
dashboard <https://www.dashboard.modlee.ai/>`__.

**NOTE: if you are completing a Modlee Screening Exercise for a job
interview, make sure that you sign up for a Modlee Account with the same
email that your invite was sent to.**

Replace ``"replace-with-your-api-key"`` with your API key. Run the
following two cells; they will execute successively. This process may
take a few minutes, so you can `review the
examples <https://docs.modlee.ai/notebooks/document.html>`__ while
waiting.

.. code:: ipython3

    %load_ext autoreload
    %autoreload 2
    
    # Set your API key
    import os
    #simulate setting environment variable
    os.environ['MODLEE_API_KEY'] = "GZ4a6OoXmCXUHDJGnnGWNofsPrK0YF0i"
    api_key = os.environ['MODLEE_API_KEY']
    assert api_key != "replace-with-your-api-key", "Please update the placeholder for your Modlee API key. See above Installation instructions."

    The autoreload extension is already loaded. To reload it, use:
      %reload_ext autoreload


Step 2
------

Time to import our packages for this exercise.

**Exercise setup**
==================

Please update ``exercise_id``, ``exercise_modality``, and
``exercise_task`` below.

If you are completing a Screening Exercise for an organization please
copy the ``exercise_id``, ``exercise_modality``, and ``exercise_task``
given to you in your invite email and paste below.

.. code:: ipython3

    exercise_id = 'TS-M4_GM_A_E_H__323565277395'
    exercise_modality = 'time_series'

**Dataset setup**
=================

**Please do not make changes to the following cell**

For the machine learning interview exercise, the dataset has already
been prepared for you. Please utilize the provided code snippet below to
configure your environment appropriately. This dataset is a carefully
curated blend of publicly available datasets, designed to assess
specific competencies in model development and performance evaluation.
As the focus of this exercise is not on data manipulation, you are
requested not to make any modifications to the dataloader settings. This
ensures that you can direct your efforts towards strategic model
building and analysis tasks.

.. code:: ipython3

    root_url = 'https://evalserver.modlee.ai:6060'
    url = f"{root_url}/get-interview-utils"  # Change the port if your Flask app is running on a different one
    response = requests.get(url, params={'api_key': api_key,'exercise_id':exercise_id})
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open('interview_utils.py', 'wb') as file:
            for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):
                file.write(chunk)
        print("File downloaded and saved as interview_utils.py")
    else:
        print("Failed to download file:", response.status_code)
    
    from interview_utils import *
    from interview_utils import setup,submit
    
    train_dataloader, val_dataloader, train_dataloader_shape, val_dataloader_shape = setup(api_key,exercise_id)

    output_size = train_dataloader_shape[2]
    output_seq_len = val_dataloader_shape[1]  # 7 time steps for prediction

**Define your models**
======================

**Critical segment of your machine learning interview**

Please define and experiment with various deep neural network
architectures. Your task is to identify and implement a model structure
that will perform optimally on the provided interview dataset. It is
essential that your model design adheres to the specified solution
requirements previously stated. This exercise aims to showcase your
ability to innovate and apply your ML knowledge effectively in
developing custom neural network based solutions.

Please follow our `Custom Model Definition
Guidelines <https://docs.modlee.ai/notebooks/model_definition_guidelines.html>`__
throughout your experimentation to ensure your submitions are evaluated
properly.

**Train your models**
=====================

**Please do not make changes to the following cell**

In this phase of your machine learning interview exercise, you are
tasked with training your previously defined model using Modleeâ€™s
advanced training infrastructure. Our trainers, specifically the
trainer_for_modality_task instances, are equipped with robust
out-of-the-box training features such as learning rate decay, early
stopping, and more. Please utilize these settings to train your model.
This approach is not only designed to streamline the training process
but also allows us to assess your proficiency in optimizing and refining
deep learning models through architectural adjustments. This step is
crucial in demonstrating your ability to enhance model performance
within given constraints.

**Evaluate your models**
========================

**Please do not make changes to the following cell**

Please submit your model experiment to Modlee for evaluation. We will
provide you with detailed feedback including accuracy, model size, and
additional metrics. Keep in mind that **there are no penalties for
submitting suboptimal solutions**, so feel free to submit multiple
models as needed.

.. code:: ipython3

    submit(api_key,exercise_id,model,None,modlee)
    print('As a reminder, your exercises model_size_restriction_MB is ',model_size_restriction_MB)


.. parsed-literal::

    Request was successful.
    Response: {'mean_square_error': '1.0811', 'model_size (MB)': '0.26', 'submission_id': 'TS-E-2024-08-25T19:24:48.179727_70738853129'}
    As a reminder, your exercises model_size_restriction_MB is  10


**Great work, now keep exploring more models!**
===============================================

Use the insights gained from each evaluation to iteratively refine your
modelâ€™s architecture. This process is designed to help you optimize your
solution effectively, utilizing real-world feedback to enhance your
approach.

Solution Requirements
---------------------

-  Maximize evaluation accuracy
-  Ensure your models donâ€™t go over model size restrictions

Expectations
------------

-  Candidates typically experiment with at least **10** different model
   architectures during this exercise: defining the model, training, and
   submitting for evaluation

Evaluating your performance
---------------------------

-  We want to see your experimenation process so just work as you
   normally would
-  We will take your best model as your final submission, and do not
   penalize sub-optimal submissions. Feel free to submit as many models
   as you want to for evaluation.
