## Formatting Data Loaders and Datasets

Properly formatted datasets and data loaders are crucial for efficient data management during model training and evaluation. Ensuring that your data is well-structured and correctly handled contributes significantly to smooth operations and effective model performance.

### Dataset Guidelines

Properly formatted datasets ensure that Modlee can efficiently extract and process metadata, which is essential for accurate model recommendations and analysis. A flat, simple list format helps avoid complications and facilitates seamless integration with Modlee’s automated features. Here’s how you should format them:

1. **Data Structure**: Organize your dataset as a flat, simple list where each element is a list containing features and the target value. For example:
   
    ```python
    [[feature1, feature2, feature3, ..., target], ...]
    ```

    Here, `feature1`, `feature2`, etc., are your input data points (e.g., images, text), and `target` is the value your model should predict.

2. **Avoid Nested Data Structures**: Avoid using complex, nested lists like:
   
    ```python
    [[[feature1, feature2], feature3, ..., target], ...]
    ```

    A simple format is more compatible with Modlee’s automated analysis and ensures efficient data handling.

**Example Custom Dataset Class**: Define your dataset using `PyTorch’s Dataset` class. Here’s an example:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        feature1 = torch.tensor(self.data[idx][0], dtype=torch.float32)
        feature2 = torch.tensor(self.data[idx][1], dtype=torch.float32)
        feature3 = torch.tensor(self.data[idx][2], dtype=torch.float32)
        features = [feature1, feature2, feature3]
        target = torch.tensor(self.data[idx][-1], dtype=torch.float32).squeeze()
        return features, target

def example_text():
    return np.random.rand(10)  # 1D array of 10 random numbers

def example_image():
    return np.random.rand(5, 3)  # 2D array of random numbers

def example_video():
    return np.random.rand(5, 3, 2)  # 3D array of random numbers

def example_target():
    return np.random.rand(1)  # Scalar value

data = [[example_text(), example_image(), example_video(), example_target()] for _ in range(4)]
dataset = CustomDataset(data)
```

This code defines a custom PyTorch dataset class, `CustomDataset`, which handles data in a list format and converts it into `PyTorch` tensors. It includes functions to generate example data for different types of features and targets. The `dataset` instance is initialized with this example data and is ready for use with a `DataLoader` to facilitate model training or evaluation.

### Proper Data Loader Formatting
Data loaders are crucial for efficiently feeding data into your model during training and evaluation. Here’s how you should format them:

1. **DataLoader Structure**: Ensure that your data loaders are structured to handle batches of data. Use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to create data loaders from your dataset. Configure parameters like `batch_size`, `shuffle`, and `num_workers`.
  
    Example:

    ```python
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)

    # Iterate through dataloader
    for i,batch in enumerate(dataloader):
        print(f"- batch_{i}")
        features, target = batch
        for j,feature in enumerate(features):
            print(f"feature_{j}.shape = ", feature.shape)
        print("target.shape = ", target.shape)
    ```
    Output:

    ```shell
    - batch_0
    feature_0.shape =  torch.Size([2, 10])
    feature_1.shape =  torch.Size([2, 5, 3])
    feature_2.shape =  torch.Size([2, 5, 3, 2])
    target.shape =  torch.Size([2])
    - batch_1
    feature_0.shape =  torch.Size([2, 10])
    feature_1.shape =  torch.Size([2, 5, 3])
    feature_2.shape =  torch.Size([2, 5, 3, 2])
    target.shape =  torch.Size([2])
    ```

    Pass your dataset to a PyTorch DataLoader, so that Modlee can automatically parse it for meta features, allowing you to share it in a meaningful way with your colleagues.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your data is preprocessed to match the input requirements of your model. This may include normalization, resizing, or other transformations.

3. **Data Splitting**: Split your data into training, validation, and test sets, and create separate data loaders for each.

class MyModel(modlee.model.ModleeModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32*28*28, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 32*28*28)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
```
2. **Configuration**: Configure your model with parameters such as learning rate and optimizer settings. Use Modlee’s built-in methods to handle these configurations.

3. **Training and Evaluation**: Use Modlee’s training and evaluation functions to manage the training process and assess model performance.
