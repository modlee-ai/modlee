# How to report a bug
### Security vulnerabilities
If you find a security vulnerability, **please do NOT open an issue**. Please report the vulnerability to [brad@modlee.ai](brad@modlee.ai).

When filing a bug report as an issue, please include the following information:
1. Versions of your technical stack:
    - Operating system
    - Python
    - Framework (PyTorch)
2. Actions you took — what steps led to the error?
3. Expected functionality — what did you *expect* to happen?
4. Actual functionality - what *actually* happened?

Please post feature requests as an issue with the following information:

1. Description of the proposed feature.
2. Motivation for the feature (e.g. bug fix, quality-of-life improvement, expanding usability).
3. Rough outline of proposed implementation (e.g. use `x` framework in `y` module).
